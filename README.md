# DBoards

Personal project built in Sinatra over the weekend of week 4 DBC.

## Desription

DBC is filled with whiteboards that are constantly being used.  Most of the time, it is hard to keep track of what can be erased and what cannot.  It also means that any work you have will be gone quickly with no way to reference back to it.  This app allows for the image uploading and tagging of your whiteboard so that it will never be lost again.

## Features

* CRUD
* User Authentication
* Secure password with Bcrypt
* Image upload
* Tagging

## Design

This app can also be used to store/tag other items like schemas.
