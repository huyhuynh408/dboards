# DBoards

DBC is filled with white boards that are constantly being used.  Most of the time, it is hard to keep track of what can be erased and what cannot.  It also means that any work you have will be gone quickly with no way to reference back to it.  This app allows for the image uploading and tagging of your white board so that it will never be lost again.
